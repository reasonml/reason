synopsis: "Terminal manipulation library for OCaml"
description: """
Lambda-term is a cross-platform library for manipulating the terminal. It
provides an abstraction for keys, mouse events, colors, as well as a set of
widgets to write curses-like applications. The main objective of lambda-term is
to provide a higher level functional interface to terminal manipulation than,
for example, ncurses, by providing a native OCaml interface instead of bindings
to a C library. Lambda-term integrates with zed to provide text edition
facilities in console applications."""
