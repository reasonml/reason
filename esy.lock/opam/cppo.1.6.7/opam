synopsis: "Code preprocessor like cpp for OCaml"
description: """
Cppo is an equivalent of the C preprocessor for OCaml programs.
It allows the definition of simple macros and file inclusion.

Cppo is:

* more OCaml-friendly than cpp
* easy to learn without consulting a manual
* reasonably fast
* simple to install and to maintain
