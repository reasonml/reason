Tools
==============

`Reason` includes several tools that are specifically designed to work well with
`Reason`'s syntax toolchain. Reason also curates and extends the best
existing tools for the `ocaml` compiler.

`refmt`
========
Line-wrapping AST based formatting is an important feature of `Reason`
that integrates with your editing experience. `Reason` includes a powerful,
consistent syntax formatter/converter called `refmt`, that can parse, and print
the `Reason` syntax at arbitrary width wrappings, while interleaving comments.
It can also be used to convert between multiple syntaxes.

<img src="images/LiquidSmallOptCrop.gif" width=466 height=433 />

> This example demonstrates running `refmt` dynamically as the window resizes
in order to make optimal use of screen real estate while still abiding
perfectly by the formatting rules. This is _not_ the typical naive editor
wrapping that simply pushes text out of the way.

> Note: In practice, you would not run `refmt` upon window resize. You would
normally configure indentation/width settings at the repo/project level.

####Uses
- Automatically format your source to arbitrary widths - configurable per project.
- Maintain consistent style across a team, project, and new contributors.
- Stop wasting time manually enforcing formatting rules at diff review. Let a
computer do it instead.
- Automatically upgrade your source when a new version of `Reason` includes
a syntax feature that you want to make use of.


`refmt` is **_optional_**. Some might only want to use `refmt` occasionally,
when upgrading their source code to include new syntax features, and others
will want to run it after every new line of code directly from their editor.

####Options
You can specify which syntax to parse, and which to print via `-parse` and
`-print` flags. For example, you can convert your `ocaml` project to `Reason`
by processing each file with the command `refmt -parse ml -print
re yourFile.ml`. Execute `refmt -help` for more options.



Merlin
=======
[`Merlin`](https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin) is a powerful, intelligent, interactive IDE toolchain that works with
artifacts generated by the `ocaml` compiler.  Because `Reason` uses the `ocaml`
compiler, `Merlin` and `Reason` can play well together.

As part of the `Reason` effort, the official `Merlin` project has been
generalized enough to support the level of customization required by `Reason`
while still allowing `Reason` to use all of `Merlin`'s advanced features such
as:

- Type driven autocompletion.
- Recovering type checking, and displaying of multiple parse errors in the editor.
- Displaying type errors.
- Refactoring and jumping to definitions.

`Reason` comes with editor plugins for all of the following editors, and all of
them use `Merlin` to power their type driven interactive editing experience.


### Atom

##### Install
`Reason` works best in Atom when the `Nuclide` plugin is installed. There is _one_ plugin called `atom-reason-loader` that must be installed using the instructions here.
`atom-reason-loader` has one job - to dynamically install any other necessary `Reason` plugins. Your
OPAM installation of `Reason` provides the _real_ IDE plugins, that `atom-reason-loader` will install.
Those other plugins include `NuclideReason` (IDE features), and `language-reason` (syntax highlighting).

> **Installation Instructions**
>
> - Install [Atom](https://atom.io/) editor.
> - Open the package installer from the menu `Packages > Settings View > Install Packages/Themes`.
> - Search for and install `nuclide` if not already installed.
> - Then install `atom-reason-loader`.
> - `atom-reason-loader` will automatically install/load two plugins (`NuclideReason` and
> `language-reason`) and will walk you through removing any existing conflicting versions.
> - When installation is complete, open a `.re` file and make sure the `Reason` syntax is selected
> (lower right corner of Atom). Restarting Atom after installation is not a bad idea but should not be necessary.

#### Features/Configuration
The `Reason` IDE experience is powered by `refmt`, the `Reason` AST formatting tool, and
even more so by the excellent [merlin](https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin) project.
`refmt` provides source code beautifying/printing, and Merlin provides type information, autocompletion,
and professional IDE features even in the face of partially invalid files/projects.

To configure Merlin, include a `.merlin` file at the root of your project that notes the location
of source files and build artifacts.
See [this doc](https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin/wiki/project-configuration) for more
details, and note the example here.


> Example `.merlin` file
```
S relative/path/to/your/sourcefiles/dir/
B relative/path/to/your/build/artifacts/dir/
```

<img width=470 height=440 src="images/NuclideReason.png" />

> **Type Driven Development**
>
> - With [`hyperclick`](https://atom.io/packages/hyperclick) installed/enabled -
`⌘+click` will allow navigating to definition location.
> - When you save your file, you will see compilation errors/warnings highlighted.
> Open the "Diagnostics" window to see a summary of errors.
> - With `Nuclide` type-hints enabled, hovering over your source code will display
> a pretty printed type annotation for the term.


<img width=470 height=440 src="images/AutoFormat.png" />

> **Powerful Reformatting**
>
> - `Reason` for Atom integrates `refmt`, the `Reason` AST formatter.
> - With Nuclide, `⌘+shift+c` will reformat the entire file or let you know
> if a syntax error prevented formatting.
> - As always, `refmt` will remove superfluous parenthesis, or precedence tokens.
> - `refmt` will wrap your lines at the width you have configured in your
> plugin settings. To change these, open the Package Settings (`Packages > Settings View > Manage Packages)
> and click on `NuclideReason` in order to customize the "print width" configuration.

### Vim

The [VimReason Plugin](https://github.com/facebook/reason/tree/master/editorSupport/VimReason) plugin
implements all the features that the Atom plugin implements.

 * **Syntax Highlighting **
 * **Error Reporting **
 * **Powerful source formatting/indenting/wrapping **

### Emacs

The [Emacs Plugin](https://github.com/facebook/reason/tree/master/editorSupport/emacs)
has the same feature set that the Vim plugin supports.


`rtop`
========
Reason comes with
[`rtop`](file:///Users/jwalke/githubdocs/Reason/index.html#reason-repl), a
`REPL` that parses `Reason` syntax and prints compiler feedback in the `Reason` syntax.



Integration
======

`Reason`'s included `refmt` program can be used to automatically upgrade part
of your project to `Reason`'s syntax.

#### Upgrade Your Project From OCaml to Reason:

The converted Reason code may attach `[@implicit_arity]` to constructors like `C 1 2 [@implicit_arity]`.
This is due to the fact that OCaml has the ambiguous syntax where a multi-arguments
constructor is expecting argument in a tuple form. So at parsing time we don't
know if `C (1, 2)` in OCaml should be translated to `C (1, 2)` or `C 1 2` in Reason.
By default, we will convert it to `C 1 2 [@implicit_arity]`, which tells the compiler
this can be either `C 1 2` or `C (1, 2)`.

To prevent `[@implicit_arity]` from being generated, one can supply `-assume-explicit-arity`
to `refmt`. This forces the formatter to generate `C 1 2` instead of `C 1 2 [@implicit_arity]`.

However, since `C 1 2` requires multiple arugments, it may fail the compilation if it is actually
a constructor with a single tuple as an arugment (e.g., `Some`).
We already have some internal exception rules to cover the common constructors who requires a single tuple
as argument so that they will be converted correctly (e.g., `Some (1, 2)` will be converted
to `Some (1, 2)` instead of `Some 1 2`, which doesn't compile).

To provide your own exception list, create a line-separated file that contains all constructors (without module prefix)
in your project that expects a single tuple as argument, and use `-heuristics-file <filename>`
to tell `refmt` that all constructors
listed in the file will be treated as constructor with a single tuple as argument:

```sh
> cat heuristics.txt
  TupleConstructor
  And
  Or
```

```sh
> cat test.ml
```

```ocaml
type tm =
  TupleConstructor of (int * int)
| MultiArgumentsConstructor of int * int
let x = TupleConstructor(1, 2)
let y = MultiArgumentsConstructor(1, 2)
module Test = struct
  type a = | And of (int * int) | Or of (int * int)
end;;
let a = Test.And (1, 2)
let b = Test.Or (1, 2)
let c = Some (1, 2)
```

Then only the constructor identifiers that were listed will be assumed to accept tuples instead of multiple arguments.

```sh
> refmt -heuristics-file \
    ./heuristics.txt -assume-explicit-arity \
    -parse ml -print re test.ml
```


```reason
  type tm =
    | TupleConstructor of (int, int)
    | MultiArgumentsConstructor of int int;

let x = TupleConstructor (1, 2);
let y = MultiArgumentsConstructor 1 2;
let module Test = {
  type a = | And of (int, int) | Or of (int, int);
};
let a = Test.And (1, 2);
let b = Test.Or (1, 2);
let c = Some (1, 2);
```


#### Upgrading `Reason` Source Code After Changing Parse/Printing:
To upgrade existing `Reason` code to a new version of the `Reason` syntax,
you should parse the code with the old version of the parser, and print it with
the new version of the printer. The easiest way to do this is to build the new
version of `Reason` locally, while the old one is pinned globally, but any way that you
have two versions installed locally will work.

The script `upgradeSyntax.sh` will execute reformattings for the entire
subdirectory repo across two separate builds of `Reason`. It expects you to
supply the path/command to the old build of Reason, the path/command for the
new build of Reason, and the print width (use `110`).  For example, if you had
an old version of `Reason` globally pinned as `refmt`, and a local build of
`Reason` at `~/github/Reason/refmt_impl.native`:

```sh
# Run from whichever directory you want to search
~/github/Reason/upgradeSyntax.sh refmt ~/github/Reason/refmt_impl.native 110
```



Current Tooling
-----------

####OCamlBuild
`Reason` comes with a drop in replacement for `ocamlbuild` called `rebuild`, that
will automatically build any `reason` file along with your `ocaml` files, with
no additional configuration. This allows you to add `Reason` files to your existing
`OCaml` project bit by bit. Wherever your script refer to `ocamlbuild`, just replace
it with `rebuild`.

####Clang
We will update this document with instructions for integrating with `clang/gcc`.

####Makefile
If your build system executes explicit build commands, then the easiest way to
use `Reason` with `ocamlopt/ocamlc` is by adding the following flags to each
compilation step:
```sh
# intf-suffix tells the compiler where to look for corresponding interface files
ocamlopt -pp refmt -intf-suffix rei -impl myFile.re
ocamlopt -pp refmt -intf myFile.rei

```


Deeper OCaml integration
---------------------------

If you are using `ocamlbuild`, without `rebuild` add the following to your
`_tags` file, but this likely won't be enough because `ocamlc`/`ocamlopt` will
need the `-intf/-impl/-intf-suffix` flags:

```
<**/*.{re,.rei}>: package(reason), syntax(utf8)
```
