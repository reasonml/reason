/* - A good way to test if formatting of infix operators groups precedences
   correctly, is to write an expression twice. Once in a form where parenthesis
   explicitly group according to the parse tree and write it another time
   without any parenthesis. After formatting, the two should be equal

   - Reformatting n > 0 times should be idempotent.

     * #NotActuallyAConflict
     * Note that there's a difference with how = and := behave.
     * We only *simulate* = being an infix identifier for the sake of printing,
     * but for parsing it's a little more nuanced. There *isn't* technically a
     * shift/reduce conflict in the following that must be resolved via
     * precedence ranking:
     *
     *     a + b.c = d
     *
     * No conflict between reducing a + b.c, and shifting =, like there would
     * be if it was := instead of =. That's because the rule for = isn't the
     * infix rule with an arbitrary expression on its left - it's something
     * much more specific.
     *
     * (simple_expr) DOT LIDENT EQUAL expression.
     *
     * So with the way yacc/menhir works, when it sees an equal sign, it knows
     * that there is no valid parse where a + b.c is reduced to an expression
     * with an = immediately appearing after, so it shifts the equals.
     *
     * If you replace = with :=, you'd see different behavior.
     *
     *     a + b.c := d
     *
     *  Since := has lower precedence than +, it would be parsed as:
     *
     *     (a + b.c) := d
     *
     * However, our printing logic will print = assignment with parenthesis:
     *
     *     a + (b.c = d)
     *
     * Even though they're not needed, because it doesn't know details about
     * which rules are valid, we just told it to print = as if it were a valid
     * infix identifier.
     *
     * Another case:
     *
     *    something >>= fun x => x + 1;
     *
     * Will be printed as:
     *
     *    something >>= (fun x => x + 1);
     *
     * Because the arrow has lower precedence than >>=, but it wasn't needed because
     *
     *    (something >>= fun x) => x + 1;
     *
     * Is not a valid parse. Parens around the `=>` weren't needed to prevent
     * reducing instead of shifting. To optimize this part, we need a much
     * deeper encoding of the parse rules to print parens only when needed.
