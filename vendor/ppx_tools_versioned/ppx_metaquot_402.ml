(* A -ppx rewriter to be used to write Parsetree-generating code
   (including other -ppx rewriters) using concrete syntax.

   We support the following extensions in expression position:

   [%expr ...]  maps to code which creates the expression represented by ...
   [%pat? ...] maps to code which creates the pattern represented by ...
   [%str ...] maps to code which creates the structure represented by ...
   [%stri ...] maps to code which creates the structure item represented by ...
   [%type: ...] maps to code which creates the core type represented by ...

   Quoted code can refer to expressions representing AST fragments,
   using the following extensions:

     [%e ...] where ... is an expression of type Parsetree.expression
     [%t ...] where ... is an expression of type Parsetree.core_type
     [%p ...] where ... is an expression of type Parsetree.pattern


   All locations generated by the meta quotation are by default set
   to [Ast_helper.default_loc].  This can be overriden by providing a custom
   expression which will be inserted whereever a location is required
   in the generated AST.  This expression can be specified globally
   (for the current structure) as a structure item attribute:

     ;;[@@metaloc ...]

   or locally for the scope of an expression:

     e [@metaloc ...]



   Support is also provided to use concrete syntax in pattern
   position.  The location and attribute fields are currently ignored
   by patterns generated from meta quotations.

   We support the following extensions in pattern position:

   [%expr ...]  maps to code which creates the expression represented by ...
   [%pat? ...] maps to code which creates the pattern represented by ...
   [%str ...] maps to code which creates the structure represented by ...
   [%type: ...] maps to code which creates the core type represented by ...

   Quoted code can refer to expressions representing AST fragments,
   using the following extensions:

     [%e? ...] where ... is a pattern of type Parsetree.expression
     [%t? ...] where ... is a pattern of type Parsetree.core_type
     [%p? ...] where ... is a pattern of type Parsetree.pattern
