Basics
=======

Reason's syntax is similar to that of modern JavaScript, Flow or Rust. The
examples in this document give an overview of the most important language
constructs and their syntax.

Primitives / Operations
----------

Primitive                             | Example
--------------------------------------|--------------------------------
Strings                               |  <pre>"Hello"</pre>
Characters                            |  <pre>'x'</pre>
Integers                              |  <pre>23</pre>
Floats                                |  <pre>23.0</pre>
Negative Integers                     |  <pre>-23</pre>
Integer Addition                      |  <pre>23 + 1</pre>
Float Addition                        |  <pre>23.0 +. 1.0</pre>
Integer Division/Multiplication       |  <pre>2 / 23 * 1</pre>
Float Division/Multiplication         |  <pre>2.0 /. 23.0 \*. 1.0</pre>
String Concatenation                  |  <pre>"Hello " ^ "World"</pre>
Immutable Lists                       |  <pre>[1, 2, 3]</pre>
Immutable Prepend                     |  <pre>[item1, item2, ...theRest]</pre>
Reference Equality                    |  <pre>thisThing === thatThing</pre>
Records                               |  <pre>{score: 100}</pre>


Let Bindings
------------
`let` bindings give names to values. They bindings can be seen and referenced
by code that comes after those bindings.

```reason
let greeting = "hello!";
let score = 10;
let newScore = 10 + score;
...
```

#### Scope

Reason has block scope through `{}`.

```reason
let message = {
  let part1 = "hello";
  let part2 = "world";
  part1 ^ " " ^ part2
};
/* `part1` and `part2` not accessible here! */
```

#### Bindings Are Immutable

Once a binding refers to a value, it cannot refer to anything else (unless it
explicitly contains a mutable value, discussed later). However, you may create a
new binding of the same name which will *shadow* the previous binding; from that
point onward, the binding will refer to the newly assigned value.

```reason
let msg = "hello";
print_endline msg; /* Prints "hello" */
let msg = "bye";
print_endline msg; /* Prints "bye" */
```

Functions
---------

Functions are declated with `fun` and return the expression.

```reason
fun greet name => "Hello " ^ name;
```

For longer functions, you'd surround the body with a block:

```reason
fun greetMore name => {
  let part1 = "Hello";
  part1 ^ " " ^ name
};
```

Functions are first class; you can use `let` bindings to give them names.

```reason
let increment = fun x => x + 1;
let double = fun x => x + x;
```

To call a function, supply its argument after the name of the function.

```reason
let five = increment 4;
let eleven = increment (double 5);
```

**Note the calling precedence**! If you forget to wrap `double 5` in parentheses,
you'd get `increment double 5`, as if the `increment` function wrongly takes two
arguments.

#### Arguments & Sugar

Functions can receive many arguments:

```reason
let add = fun x y => x + y;
```

Actually, this is actually nothing but syntactic sugar for this:

```reason
let add = fun x => fun y => x + y;
```

Naively, this would have been expensive (2 functions creations instead of 1).
But OCaml optimizes this into a single function with two arguments under the
hood! This way, we get

- Nice syntax
- Currying for free
- No performance cost

Cherry on top: we have a short form for `let` + `fun`:

```reason
let add = fun x y => x + y;
let add x y => x + y; /* note the arrow */
/* these two are equivalent */
```

To verify these sugars for yourself, write `let add = fun x => fun y => x + y`
in your editor and use `refmt` on it; see it become `let add x y => x + y`.

#### No Argument

A function always takes an argument; but sometimes, we'd use it for e.g. side-effects, and don't really have anything to pass to it. In this case, we'd pass it the "special" value `()`.

```reason
/* receive & destructure the unit argument */
let logSomething () => {
  print_endline "hello";
  print_endline "world";
};

/* call the function with the value of type unit */
logSomething ()
```

Actually, `()` is a totally normal value, of type "unit". `()` is the single possible value in `unit`. Reason/OCaml gave it a special syntax out of convenience.

Types
--------------------------

#### Type Annotations

Types can be inferred or explicitly written down by choice.

```reason
let score: int = 10;
```

You can also wrap an expression in parentheses and annotate it:

```reason
let myInt = 5;
let myInt = (5 : int);
let myInt = (5 : int) + (4 : int);
let add (x: int) (y: int) :int => x + y;
```

<br />

#### Type Aliases

You can refer to a type by a different name:

```reason
type scoreType = int;
let x: scoreType = 10;
```

Primitive Data Types
=======

Tuples
--------------------------

Tuples are

- immutable
- ordered
- fixed-sized
- heterogenous

```reason
let myThreeFloats = (20.0, 30.0, 100.0);
let myIntAndString = (20, "totallyNotAnInteger");
```

Tuples' types can be used in type annotations as well. Tuple types visually resemble tuples values.

```reason
let myThreeFloats: (float, float, float) = 
  (20.0, 30.0, 100.0);
/* a tuple type alias */
type myPair = (int, string);
let myIntAndString: myPair = 
  (20, "totallyNotAnInteger");
```

**Note**: there's no tuple of size 1.

Records
-------

Records are a set of named values. They resemble "objects" but are
- lighter
- immutable by default
- less flexible
- much faster

```reason
type person = {age: int, name: string}; /* type */
let me = {age: 30, name: "Jordan"}; /* value */
print_string me.name; /* field access */
```

**Note**: Records must have a type definition.

New records can be created from old records with the `...` spread operator. The
original record isn't mutated.

```reason
let meNextYear = {...me, age: me.age + 1};
```

**Note**: spread cannot add new fields.

##### Sugar

To reduce redundancy, we provide "punning" for a record's types and values.

When the name of a field coincides with the type of a record field in a record
definition, Reason provides a handy syntactic shortcut. For example, the field
name `horsePower` binds the `type horsePower` to its name. This is called **punning**.

```reason
type horsePower = {power: int, metric: bool};

let metric = true;
let power1 = {power: 10, metric};
/* same as: {power: 10, metric: metric}; */

type car = {name: string, horsePower};
/* same as: {name: string, horsePower: horsePower}; */
```

**Note**: there's no punning for a single record field! `{foo}` doesn't do what
you expect (it's a block that returns the value `foo`).

##### Mutable Fields

Record fields can optionally be mutable. This allows you to update those fields in-place with the `=` operator.

```reason
type person = {
  name: string,
  mutable age: int
};
let me = {name: "Jordan", age: 30};
me.age = me.age + 1; /* alter `me`. Happy birthday! */
```

Destructuring
-------------
"Destructuring" can be used to extract one or more fields from a record or
tuple, while automatically binding them to local variables. Any place variables
are introduced into scope, you may use destructuring. To destructure, instead
of writing the variable name as usual, write out the deep shape of the object.


> The following binds variables:
> `ten = 10`, `twenty = 20`

```reason
let someInts = (10, 20);
let (ten, twenty) = someInts;
```

> The following binds variables:
> `n = "Guy"`, `a = 30`

```reason
type person = {name: string, age: int};
let somePerson = {name: "Guy", age: 30};
let {name: n, age: a} = somePerson;
```

Destructuring also allows type annotations *while* destructuring.
```reason
let (ten: int, twenty: int) = someInts;
let {name: (n:string), age: (a:int)} = somePerson;
```

More on Functions
-------------------------

#### Function Types
Function types are written by listing the argument type, an arrow, and then
the return type.

```reason
argumentType => expressionType
```

Here, we create a type alias for the types of functions in the previous
examples and then we assert that they are compatible with those functions.

```reason
type intTupleToInt = (int, int) => int;
type intToInt = int => int;
let a = (increment : intToInt);
let b = (addTupleFields : intTupleToInt);
```

#### Recursive Functions

By default, values can't see a binding that points to it, but including the
`rec` keyword in a `let` binding makes this possible. This allows functions
to see and call themselves, giving us the power of recursion.

```reason
let rec neverTerminate = fun () => neverTerminate ();
```

#### Mutually Recursive Functions

Mutually recursive functions start like a single recursive function using the
`rec` keyword, and then are chained together with `and`:

```reason
let rec callSecond = fun () => callFirst ()
and callFirst = fun () => callSecond ();
```

#### Functions Returning Functions

Functions can return other functions. Here's a function `createAdder` that
creates an adder function. We call `createAdder` first with `4`, and then call
the result of that with `1`.

```reason
let createAdder = fun addAmount => (
  fun x => addAmount + x
);
let five = createAdder(4)(1);
```

`createAdder` has the following type. This type tells us that it is a function
that when called with an `int`, will return *another* function. That returned
function itself expects an `int` and returns an `int`. The parenthesis may be
omitted.

```reason
int => (int => int)
```

This pattern is called "currying", and because it is so common, `Reason`
includes some syntactic sugar for it. Here is the previous example, but written
using the syntactic sugar. Many people use this pattern because it simulates
multiple arguments.


```reason
let createAdder = fun addAmount x => addAmount + x;
let five = createAdder 4 1;
```
> Note: Curried functions don't typically incur performance hit when all the
arguments are supplied at once because intermediate function allocations are
optimized away!

[Learn more about currying](#diving-deeper-curried-functions)


Variants
--------

Variant types allows data to have either one form *or* another. In Reason, each
form is given a capitalized name called a "constructor" (not in the OO sense).
To declare a variant type, enumerate every constructor by the `|` token.

```reason
type response =
  | Yes
  | No
  | PrettyMuch;
let areYouCrushingIt = Yes;
```

A `switch` expression is like a large `if/elseif/elseif..`, but much more
powerful. To use it, enumerate every variant constructor, each followed by an `=>`
and the expression that the entire `switch` should evaluate to for that case. In
this example, the `message` variable is assigned the string `"..."`.

```reason
let isSafeToLaunchRocket = PrettyMuch;
let message = switch isSafeToLaunchRocket {
  | No => "Check Integrity."
  | Yes => "All Systems Go."
  | PrettyMuch => "..."
};
```

The compiler will raise a type error if you've forgotten to cover a case of your
variant, or if two cases are redundant. You can also destructure while
enumerating the cases. See more below.

##### Constructor Arguments

Reason constructors are not your OO constructors. They're more like functions
for variants. They may contain one or more pieces of data by declaring those
contained types in a space-separated list after the constructor.

```reason
type account =
  | None
  | Facebook string int
  | Instagram string;
```

> Instantiating a constructor that carries data is exactly the same as
calling a function. Supply the data as space separated "arguments".

```reason
/* Accepts 2 arguments */
let myAccount = Facebook "Kay" 1234; 
/* Accepts 0 arguments */
let yourAccount = None;              
```

##### Destructuring Arguments of a Constructor

Once created, constructor data can be extracted via destructuring, much like
with tuples. In this example, a local variable `x` is bound to `42`.
`getTheInt` extracts a `Leaf`'s contained integer "on the way into" the function.

```reason
type intLeaf = | Leaf int;
let myIntLeaf = Leaf 42;

let Leaf x = myIntLeaf;
let getTheInt = fun (Leaf q) => q;
let fourtyTwo = getTheInt myIntLeaf;
let twentyNine = getTheInt (Leaf 29);
```

** When Simple Destructuring Isn't Enough: **
Simple destructuring isn't sufficient for variants types with many
constructors. The following example would clearly have to fail at runtime!
Fortunately, the compiler forbids this.

```reason
type possibleNum =
  | NotDefined
  | Defined int;

let myNumber = NotDefined;
let Defined x = myNumber;   /* Type error! */
```
** The Solution: ** To recover data in variants with many constructors,
`switch` allows us to enumerate each constructor *while* destructuring the
constructor's data on the left side of the `=>`.  Unlike our previous naive
attempt, this works because we enumerate every possible constructor name inside
of the `switch`.

> Note: We've safely unpacked the `i` from `Defined i`, because we've *also*
> specified what to do when `myNumber` was `NotDefined`.

```reason
let x = switch myNumber {
  | Defined i => i
  | NotDefined => 0
};
```
##### Multiple Arguments vs. Tuples (*Details*)

Notice that a variant constructor that contains many fields is different than a
variant constructor that carries a single field that happens to be a tuple.
Among other differences, tuples are not "inlined" into the variant object's
runtime representation, whereas, multiple constructor arguments incur no
additional abstraction cost (they are "inlined" into the variant data).

```reason
type toTupleOrNotToTuple =
   | HasTuple (int, int, int)
   | NoTuple int int int;

let aTuple = HasTuple (1, 2, 3);
let notTuple = NoTuple 1 2 3;

let sumsZero = switch x {
  | HasTuple (a, b, c) => a + b + c == 0
  | NoTuple a b c => a + b + c == 0
};

```

Loops and Tests
---------------

#### If Expressions

The syntax for `if` expressions should look very familiar. Just like within
function "bodies", the `{}` braces may include a sequence of temporary `let`
bindings or imperative commands, all separated by `;`. An `if` statement may
include an optional `else` branch.

```reason
if (testCondition) {
  ifTrue
};

if (testCondition) {
  ifTrue
} else {
  ifFalse
};
```

In this example, the word `"hi"` is printed if `sayHi` is `true`, and prints
`"bye"` otherwise.
```reason
if (sayHi) {
  print_string "hi";
} else {
  print_string "bye";
};
```

> Note: The parenthesis around the test condition may be omitted if the test
condition is "simple" enough (meaning it is a single, standalone word).

If expressions aren't just for imperative code - they can also be used to
compute a result. Just place an expression on the final line of the `{}`
sequence for each branch. If your `if` expression has no `else` branch, it
is clearly only useful for imperative programming and therefore the entire `if`
will evaluate to the unit value `()`.


```reason
let valueToLog =
  if (booleanTest) {
    let tmp = "name";
    String.capitalize_ascii tmp;
  } else {
    "default";
  };
```

`if`/`else` expressions may be chained together in a familiar manner.

```reason
if (sayHi) {
  print_string "hi";
} else if (sayBye) {
  print_string "bye";
} else {
  print_string "nothing to say";
};
```
#### Ternaries

For smaller boolean if else statements, `Reason` includes a ternary expression
which might look more aesthetically pleasing in some cases.

```reason
testCondition ? ifTrue : ifFalse
```

```reason
let valueToLog = shouldUseDefault ? 200 : yourNumber;
```


#### For Loops

For loops are fully imperative constructs that iterate through a range of
numbers, from a beginning value up to (and including) the ending value. The
general form of a `for` loop includes an identifier that is incremented each
iteration, and a range `startVal` to `endVal`.

```reason
for identifier in (startVal) to (endVal) {
  statements
};
```

The parenthesis around the `startVal` and `endVal` may be omitted if they are
clearly unnecessary as in the following example.

```reason
let xStart = 1;
let xEnd = 3;
/* prints: 1 2 3 */
for x in xStart to xEnd {
  print_int x;
  print_string " ";
};
```

You can make the `for` loop count in the opposite direction by using the `downto`
keyword.

```reason
for identifier in (startVal) downto (endVal) {
  statements
};
```

```reason
let xStart = 3;
let xEnd = 1;
/* prints: 3 2 1 */
for x in xStart downto xEnd {
  print_int x;
  print_string " ";
};
```

#### While Loops

While loops are also fully imperative constructs. They execute a code block
while some condition is true. The form of a `while` loop includes a single
expression, the condition to test.

```reason
while (testCondition) {
  statements;
};
```

The parenthesis around `testCondition` may be omitted if they are unnecessary,
such as in the following example.

```reason
while true {
  print_endline "hello";
};
```

Example to break out of a while-true loop:

```reason
Random.self_init ();
let break = {contents: false};
while (not break.contents) {
  if (Random.int 10 === 3) {
    break.contents = true
  } else {
    print_endline "hello"
  }
};
```

Type Parameters
----------
Some types are very specific, such as `int`, or `string`, but other types
are much more general. For example, knowing that a value has type `list`,
leaves so many unanswered questions - namely, what's *in* the list?! `list`
is clearly a more general type.

Recall how functions act as factories for other _values_. Supplying a function
with a parameter produces a new value. In the same way, some types, such
as `list`, act as factories for other _types_ - if you supply them a **"type
parameter"**, they generate another type.  This example shows supplying the
`list` type factory with `string`. It results in a type describing
lists of strings.

```reason
type listOfStrings = list string;
let lst : listOfStrings = ["hi", "bye"];
let lst2 : listOfStrings = 
  ["oh", "no", "not", "you", "again"];

```
> Notice the syntactic similarity between supplying function parameters and
type parameters.


You can define your own custom "type factories" by using the following syntax.
Notice the `'` before the `typeParam`. `typeStructure` can be any form of type
that is allowed to reference `typeParam`.

```reason
type typeFactoryName 'typeParam = typeStructure;
```

For example, you could define a family of tuple types like this:

```reason
type tupleTypeFactory 'a = ('a, 'a);
```

Then you could create more specific types by "calling" the `tupleTypeFactory` type
generating "function" as follows:

```reason
type tupleOfInts = tupleTypeFactory int;
type tupleOfStrings = tupleTypeFactory string;
```

To make type factories that accept multiple type parameters, list all of the
parameters next to each other. Then to use the type factory, supply all
of the type parameters as if you were calling a curried function.


```reason
type tupleOf 'left 'right = ('left, 'right);
type tupleOfIntString = tupleOf int string;
```

The type factories can define record and variant shapes that make full use of
the type parameters.

```reason
type containerOf 'a = {containedThing: 'a};
let c : containerOf int = {containedThing: 10};

type result 'a 'b =
  | Ok 'a
  | Error 'b;
let r : result string int = Ok "here is the result";
let r2 : result string int = Error 500;

```

Exceptions
----------
Exceptions are just a special kind of [variant](#syntax-basics-variants) that
can be "thrown" in exceptional cases. When you have powerful variants, you
often don't _need_ exceptions because you can just use variants types such as
the defined `type result` above. But for exceptional cases, it's great to
have the ability to throw exceptions up the call stack and catch them at
convenient recovery points. Thankfully, these two separate, but useful
constructs are unified into one handler abstraction so you can `switch` on the
result of a function call, but add cases for handling exceptions that occured.

More details coming soon.

Diving Deeper
==============

Curried Functions
-----------------

#### Currying vs. Tuples.

Instead of having a function accept a tuple as an argument, you might choose to
make that function curried instead. Currying accomplishes the same goal, but
allows you to supply the set of input data one at a time, potentially "pausing"
when you've only supplied a portion of the argument data. Compare this to
passing a tuple where you must supply all of the data at once.


#### Named Curried Functions

One downside to curried functions is that they are "biased" to arguments that
appear first. Meaning, when you curry functions, you can "partially apply" some
of the arguments, saving the rest for later, but you can only partially apply
the arguments that come *first*. Labelled curried functions address this
concern by letting you assign *labels* to arguments, and then partially apply
arguments by their label, regardless of their *position*. Labels are created by
simply prepending `labelName::` to the function argument.

```reason

let add =
  fun first::f second::s => f + s;

let result = add first::10 second::20;

let addFour = add second::4;

let five = addFour first::1;

```

Labelled curried arguments also allow setting default values using the equals
sign. The way defaults work is a little tricky, but here's the general rule:
When calling functions, default arguments are "filled in" as soon as you supply
a *non-named* argument. More specifically - all of the default arguments to the
*left* of that non-named argument are filled in, as soon as the non-named argument
is supplied at invocation time.

```reason

/* Notice how `by` is to the left of `num` */
let increment = fun by::by=0 num => num + by;

let two = increment by::1 1;

let four = increment 4;

```

It's also possible to use punning for labelled curried arguments.

```reason

let increase amount::amount => amount + 1;

```

is the same as

```reason
let increase ::amount => amount + 2;
```


Expressive Pattern Matching
---------------------------
There are several destructuring conveniences that pair well with compiler
verified `switch` expressions.
For example, you can express arbitrarily nested destructuring "patterns", which
the compiler will ensure have no uncovered cases. In this example, `name` is
bound to `"Jo"` and `model` is bound to `"Tacoma"`.

```reason
type car = {model: string, make: string};
let toyota = {make: "Toyota", model: "Tacoma"};

type carOwner =
  | CarOwner string car; /* May as well be a tuple */

let CarOwner name {model: model, make: make} = 
  CarOwner "Jo" toyota;
```

##### 
This deep pattern matching is especially expressive when used in `switch`
expressions. In this example, the function `hasExactlyTwoCars` has specified
what to return in four cases in very little code. Even more helpful, is the
fact that the compiler verifies that no two edge cases are redundant, and that
every possible case has been covered. It turns out, that pattern matching
becomes an extremely powerful tool to enforce constraints in your program. The
more you model your program in terms of variants, the more the compiler assists
you stop bugs before they even run - the end result being more rapid
development. This `ML` pattern matching is famous for coining the phrase: "If
it compiles, it works!".

```reason
type car = {maker: string, model: string};
type carList =
  | List car carList
  | NoMore;

let chevy = {maker: "Chevy", model: "Suburban"};
let toyota = {maker: "Toyota", model: "Tacoma"};
let myCarList = List chevy (List toyota NoMore);

let hasExactlyTwoCars = fun lst =>
  switch lst {
    | NoMore => false                              /* 0 */
    | List p NoMore => false                       /* 1 */
    | List p (List p2 NoMore) => true              /* 2 */
    | List p (List p2 (List p3 theRest)) => false  /* 3+ */
  };

let justTwo = hasExactlyTwoCars myCarList;  /* true! */
```

You may have noticed that in the above `hasExactlyTwoCars`, `lst` is the only
argument and is immediately used by a `switch` expression. `Reason` has a handy
syntactic alternative for this pattern:

```reason
/* Equivalent to the above `hasExactlyTwoCars` */
let hasExactlyTwoCars = fun
  | NoMore => false                              /* 0 */
  | List p NoMore => false                       /* 1 */
  | List p (List p2 NoMore) => true              /* 2 */
  | List p (List p2 (List p3 theRest)) => false; /* 3+ */
```

Objects

Although functions are the preferred way of working within Reason, it's also possible to use
objects.

An object encapsulates data that it stores within fields, and has methods that can be invoked
against the data it has.

##### Declaring an object type
An object can have an object type to define its structure.

```reason
type tesla = {
  .
  color: string
};
```
The extra dot at the beginning is to indicate that this is a closed object type, which means that
an object based on this type must have exactly this public structure.

```reason
type car 'a = {
  ..
  color: string
} as 'a;
```
Two dots, also called an elision, indicate that this is an open object type, and therefore
can also contain other values and methods. An open object is also polymorphic and therefore
requires a parameter.

An object type is not required to create an object.

##### Creating an object
```reason
type tesla = {
  .
  drive: int => int
};

let obj:tesla = {
  val hasEnvy = {contents: false};
  pub drive speed => {
    this#enableEnvy true;
    speed
  };
  pri enableEnvy envy => {
    hasEnvy.contents = envy
  };
};
```
This object is of object type tesla and has a public method `drive`. It also contains a
private method `enableEnvy` that is only accesible from within the object.

The following example shows an open object type which uses a type as parameter. The
object type parameter is required to implement all the methods of the open object
type.

```reason
type tesla 'a = {
  ..
  drive: int => int
} as 'a;

let obj: 
  tesla {. drive: int => int, doYouWant: unit => bool} 
  = {
  val hasEnvy = {contents: false};
  pub drive speed => {
    this#enableEnvy true;
    speed
  };
  pub doYouWant () => hasEnvy.contents;
  pri enableEnvy envy => {
    hasEnvy.contents = envy
  };
};
```

JSX
----------------------------------
Reason has support for JSX syntax with some slight differences compared to the one found
in JavaScript. JSX tags translate to function calls as shown in these examples:

Capitalized tag:

```reason
<MyComponent foo=bar />
```

becomes

```reason
MyComponent.createElement foo::bar children::[] () [@JSX]
```

Lowercase tag:

```reason
<div foo=bar>child1 child2</div>
```

becomes

```reason
div foo::bar children::[child1, child2] () [@JSX]
```

The `[@JSX]` syntax attribute can be safely ignored; it's a hook for potential
ppx macros to spot them and syntactically transform the preceeding expression
into something else. This way, everyone gets to benefit the JSX syntax without
needing to opt into a specific library using it, e.g. React.

Some departures from JS JSX: Children text require double quote. Attributes
don't mandate curly braces, unless they're complex expressions (in which case
they're formatted to parentheses).

```reason
<NoCurlyBraces
  booleanAttribute=true
  stringAttribute="string"
  intAttribute=1
  floatAttribute=0.1
  onClick={updater handleClick}
  thisWorksToo=(updater handleClick)>
  "foo bar"
</NoCurlyBraces>
```

There is also support for punning!

```reason
<div foo /> /* same as <div foo=foo /> */
```

Note that this would translate to `foo=true` within JSX in JS code.

There is no support for JSX spread attributes.


Automatic Printer Generation
---------------------------

*IN BETA!*

In JS, it's common to use `console.log` or `JSON.stringify` to print an object
or convert it to a string. This is not possible in OCaml. Because Reason is a
front-end to OCaml, however, we've added the functionality to convert any of
your types to a string -- for free.

```reason
type tree = Leaf | Tree tree int tree;
```

Normally, you would have to write your own stringification function to print a
`tree`, as on the right.

```reason
/* Don't you just love writing boilerplate code? */
let rec show_tree = fun
| Leaf => "Leaf"
| Tree a i b =>
  "Tree (" ^ 
  show_tree a ^ 
  ", " ^ 
  string_of_int i ^ 
  ", " ^ 
  show_tree b ^ 
  ")";
```

With Reason, however, there is no need for that. You can just assume that
`show_tree` exists (it is generated for you) and be on your merry way!

```reason
/* Golly gee! No string nonsense here! */
let myTree = Tree Leaf 4 (Tree Leaf 0 Leaf);
print_endline (show_tree myTree);
```

If you would prefer a different look for your output, feel free to override the
generated function -- simply define a function of the same name `show_tree` and
it will shadow the generated one.

Currently, this is an opt-in feature. Here's how to enable it:

* If you are using `refmt` manually, it requires adding the `--add-printers`
  flag.
* If you would like to attach the `ppx_deriving` runtime, add the
  `--add-runtime` option.
* If you are using `rebuild`, add the Ocamlbuild tag `reason.add_printers` to
  your `_tags` file for the files for which you would like printers generated.
  This implies `--add-printers --add-runtime`.

Last, please note that this will not work with polymorphic types. That is, if
you have code with a `'a` in it, Reason can't generate an automatic printer for
the generalized type.

```reason
/* Sorry, you're out of luck. */
type mytype 'a = SomeSadVariant 'a;
```

How Reason Works
=========================

The OCaml compiler is organized into several stages, which are exposed as
libraries. `Reason` replaces part of the compiler toolchain with a completely
new syntax parser that is more approachable, while still fully compatible with
the rest of the compiler.  `Reason` also implements a new source printer which
integrates into your IDE and the new custom [`REPL`](./tools.html#repl).

###### Why OCaml?

OCaml is a great tool for writing highly expressive, functional
*or* imperative code, with type inference and fast runtime performance.
Because of these properties, OCaml has helped
Facebook quickly build scalable infrastructure such as
[Hack](http://hacklang.org/), [Flow](http://flowtype.org/), and
[Infer](http://fbinfer.com/). It is also used for other performance sensitive
applications in the financial industry (Jane Street, Bloomberg). At the same
time, OCaml has a very mature (*and still growing*) ecosystem for targeting
browser and `JavaScript` environments with a focus on language interoperability
and integration with existing `JavaScript` code.


`Reason`'s non-invasive approach to the `OCaml` compiler allows `Reason` code
to take advantage of all of the existing `OCaml` compiler
optimizations/backends such as bare metal `ARM`, `x86`, and even `JavaScript`
compilation.


###### In the Wild

[Infer](https://github.com/facebook/infer/tree/master/infer) is a Facebook open
source project for statically analyzing source code in order to find errors.
You can see `Infer`'s use of `Reason`
[here](https://github.com/facebook/infer/tree/master/infer/src/IR).
The `Infer` team along with other members of industry are major contributors to
`Reason`.



###### Acknowledgments

`Reason` is also a curation of best-in-class tools. It already incorporates
several technologies that make the `Reason` developer
experience possible.

- `OCaml` itself.
- `utop` - highly customizable repl.
- `Merlin` - assistant for editing OCaml code that has extensively refactored
in order to support `Reason`.


What's Next + FAQ
=========================

#### What's Next:
- Sandboxes for locally developing large projects of interconnected smaller packages.
- Project scaffolding / build system (or merely build rules for existing systems).
- Library curation (precompiled, fast installed libraries)
- Improvements to syntax, iterating based on feedback.
- Everything installable with a single command.


#### FAQ

- **Q**: Is `ppx` supported?
- **A**: Support for `ppx` (lightweight macros for `ocaml`) is a goal which
we've made good progress towards. You should be able to use all of your
existing `ppx` plugins with `Reason`.


- **Q**: Has something like this been tried before (a different syntax for `ocaml`)?
- **A**: We're not aware of anything that takes `Reason`'s specific approach to
syntax, which pushes the major syntax customization closer into the IDE space
(and with a much greater focus on source formatting)
while relying exclusively on the new `ppx` extensions for macro-like
extensibility. `ppx` did not exist until recently and its existence
dramatically influences the approach/focus.


- **Q**: I don't like one of the syntax features.
- **A**: We are still iterating based on feedback we've received, and there's a good
chance other people feel similarly. For now, we've focused mostly on putting
all the right tools in place specifically so that we can easily make changes in
response to feedback or proposals, without having to be locked into design
decisions. Please discuss specific requests on the [Reason
project](https://github.com/facebook/reason) page.

- **Q**: I don't like semicolons, because they make code less "functional".
- **A**: Please see the last question/answer. For the specific case of semicolons,
it is false that semicolons make code any more or less functional, and at least
in `Reason`, semicolons are simply used as a delimiter that assist in formatting
and interleaving of comments. The `;` delimiter could just has easily have been
the word `in`, or the monkey emoji `🐒`. It should also be possible to remove
the need for these delimiters in all but a few cases.
