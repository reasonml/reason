What Is Reason
=======

Reason's an umbrella project that provides a curated layer for [OCaml](http://ocaml.org). We offer:

- A new, familiar syntax for the battle-tested language that is OCaml.
- A workflow for compiling to JavaScript and native code.
- A set of friendly documentations, libraries and utilities.

Why Reason
=======

Worry-free
----------

Reason leverages OCaml's language design and type system to give immediate feedback in the form of compile-time errors and avoided anti-patterns.

Low Overhead
----------

Reason keeps things simple and lean. Thanks to this, integrating Reason into your existing JavaScript/OCaml project is [hassle-free](./jsWorkflow.html#javascript-workflow-context). Do more with less; reduce your future burden!

Performant & predictable
----------

Let the compiler and the type system nudge you toward writing code that's fast and easy to think about.


Basics
=======

Reason's syntax is similar to that of modern JavaScript, Flow or Rust. The
examples in this document give an overview of the most important language
constructs and their syntax.

Records                               |  <pre>{score: 100}</pre>


Let Binding
------------
`let` bindings give names to values. They can be seen and referenced by code that comes after them.

```reason
let greeting = "hello!";
let score = 10;
let newScore = 10 + score;
...
```

#### Block Scope

Bindings can be scoped through `{}`.

```reason
let message = {
  let part1 = "hello";
  let part2 = "world";
  part1 ^ " " ^ part2
};
/* `part1` and `part2` not accessible here! */
```

#### Bindings Are Immutable

Once a binding refers to a value, it cannot refer to anything else (unless it
explicitly contains a mutable value, discussed later). However, you may create a
new binding of the same name which *shadows* the previous binding; from that
point onward, the binding will refer to the newly assigned value.

```reason
let message = "hello";
print_endline message; /* Prints "hello" */
let message = "bye";
print_endline message; /* Prints "bye" */
```

Conditionals
---------

```reason
if (showMenu) {
  displayMenu ();
};
```

Reason `if`s are expressions; they're evaluated to their body's content:

```reason
let message = if (isMorning) {
  "Good morning!"
} else {
  "Hello!"
};
```

We also have ternary sugar.

```reason
let message = isMorning ? "Good morning!" : "Hello!";
```

Function
---------

Functions are declared with `fun` and return the expression.

```reason
fun greet name => "Hello " ^ name;
```

For longer functions, you'd surround the body with a block:

```reason
fun greetMore name => {
  let part1 = "Hello";
  part1 ^ " " ^ name
};
```

Functions are first class; you can use `let` bindings to give them names.

```reason
let increment = fun x => x + 1;
let double = fun x => x + x;
```

To call a function, supply its argument after the name of the function.

```reason
let five = increment 4;
let eleven = increment (double 5);
```

**Note the calling precedence**! If you forget to wrap `double 5` in parentheses,
you'd get `increment double 5`, as if the `increment` function wrongly takes two
arguments.

#### Sugar

Functions can receive many arguments:

```reason
let add = fun x y => x + y;
```

We have a short form for `let` + `fun`:

```reason
/* equivalent to the above */
let add x y => x + y; /* note the arrow */
```

#### No Argument

A function always takes an argument; but sometimes, we'd use it for e.g. side-effects, and don't really have anything to pass to it. In this case, we'd conventionally pass it the value `()`.

```reason
/* receive & destructure the unit argument */
let logSomething () => {
  print_endline "hello";
  print_endline "world";
};

/* call the function with the value of type unit */
logSomething ();
```

`()` is a totally normal value, of type "unit". `()` is the single possible value in `unit`. Reason/OCaml gave it a special syntax out of convenience.

#### Labeled Arguments
Multi-arguments functions, especially those whose arguments are of the same type, can be confusing to call.

```reason
let addCoordinates x y => ...;
...
addCoordinates 5 6; /* which is which? */
```

In OCaml/Reason, you can attach labels to an argument:

```reason
let addCoordinates ::x ::y => ...;
...
addCoordinates x::5 y::6;
```

And since we have currying (more on that [here](#diving-deeper-more-on-functions)), we can call the function any way we want:

```reason
addCoordinates y::6 x::5;
```

Labeled arguments can be renamed inside the function for local usage:

```reason
let drawCircle radius::r color::c => {
  setColor c;
  startAt r r;
  ...
};

drawCircle radius::10 color::"red";
```

Here's the syntax for typing the arguments:

```reason
let drawCircle radius::(r: int) color::(c: string) => ...;
```

Type
--------------------------

#### Type Annotations

Types can be inferred or explicitly written down by choice.

```reason
let score: int = 10;
```

You can also wrap an expression in parentheses and annotate it:

```reason
let myInt = 5;
let myInt = (5 : int);
let myInt = (5 : int) + (4 : int);
let add (x: int) (y: int) :int => x + y;
let drawCircle radius::(r: int) :unit => ...;
```

#### Type Aliases

You can refer to a type by a different name:

```reason
type scoreType = int;
let x: scoreType = 10;
```

Built-in Data Types
=======

Tuple
--------------------------

Tuples are

- immutable
- ordered
- fixed-sized
- heterogeneous

```reason
let myThreeFloats = (20.0, 30.0, 100.0);
let myIntAndString = (20, "totallyNotAnInteger");
```

Tuples' types can be used in type annotations as well. Tuple types visually resemble tuples values.

```reason
let myThreeFloats: (float, float, float) = (20.0, 30.0, 100.0);
/* a tuple type alias */
type myPair = (int, string);
let myIntAndString: myPair = (20, "totallyNotAnInteger");
```

**Note**: there's no tuple of size 1.

Record
-------

Records are a set of named values. They resemble "objects" but are

- lighter
- immutable by default
- less flexible
- much faster

```reason
type person = {age: int, name: string}; /* type */
let me = {age: 30, name: "Jordan"}; /* value */
print_string me.name; /* field access */
```

**Note**: Records must have a type definition.

New records can be created from old records with the `...` spread operator. The
original record isn't mutated.

```reason
let meNextYear = {...me, age: me.age + 1};
```

**Note**: spread cannot add new fields.

##### Sugar

To reduce redundancy, we provide **punning** for a record's types and values. You can use it when the name of a record field matches the name of its value/type.

```reason
type horsePower = {power: int, metric: bool};

let metric = true;
let horsePower1 = {power: 10, metric};
/* same as the value {power: 10, metric: metric}; */

type car = {name: string, horsePower};
/* same as the type {name: string, horsePower: horsePower}; */
```

**Note**: there's no punning for a single record field! `{foo}` doesn't do what you expect (it's a block that returns the value `foo`).

##### Mutable Fields

Record fields can optionally be mutable. This allows you to update those fields in-place with the `=` operator.

```reason
type person = {
  name: string,
  mutable age: int
};
let me = {name: "Jordan", age: 30};
me.age = me.age + 1; /* alter `me`. Happy birthday! */
```

Variant
--------

Most data structures are about "this **and** that". A variant allows us to express "this **or** that".

```reason
type response =
| Yes
| No
| PrettyMuch;

let areYouCrushingIt = Yes;
```

`Yes`, `No` and `PrettyMuch` aren't strings, nor references, nor some special data type. They're called "constructors". The `|` bar separates each constructor.

**Note**: variant constructors need to be capitalized.

A `switch` expression is like a large `if/elseif/elseif..` allows you to check every possible case of a variant. To use it, enumerate every variant constructor, each followed by an `=>` and the expression corresponding to that case.

```reason
let message = switch (areYouCrushingIt) {
| No => "No worries. Keep going!"
| Yes => "Great!"
| PrettyMuch => "Nice!"
};
/* message is "Great!" */
```

The compiler will raise a type error if you've forgotten to cover a case of your
variant, or if two cases are redundant!

##### Constructor Arguments

Constructors can carry extra data in a space-separated list.

```reason
type account =
| None
| Instagram string;
| Facebook string int
```

Here, `Instagram` carries a `string` and `Facebook` carries a `string` and an `int`. Usage:

```reason
let myAccount = Facebook "Josh" 26;
let friendAccount = Instagram "Jenny";
```

**Note** how using a constructor is like calling a function! It's as if `Facebook` was a function that accepts two arguments. This isn't a coincidence; there's a reason why a constructor's data is called "argument".

**Note**: careful not to confuse a constructor with e.g. 2 arguments with a constructor carrying a single tuple argument:

```reason
type account =
| Facebook string int /* 2 arguments */
type account2 =
| Instagram (string, int) /* 1 argument - happens to be a 2-tuple */
```

##### Using Switch with Constructors Arguments

The `switch` expression can also let you "open up" a variant and bind its arguments to names you can refer to.

```reason
type account =
| None
| Instagram string;
| Facebook string int
let myAccount = Facebook "Josh" 26;
...
let greeting = switch (myAccount) {
| None => "Hi!"
| Facebook name age =>
  "Hi " ^ name ^ ", you're " ^ (string_of_int age) ^ "-year-old."
| Instagram name => "Hello " ^ name ^ "!"
}
```

This is called pattern-matching. It's a stronger version of destructuring, often found in other languages.


(Linked) List
-------------

Lists are homogeneous, immutable, and support fast `O(1)` append at the head of the list.

```reason
let myList = [1, 2, 3];
let anotherList = [0, ...myList]; /* myList didn't mutate */
```

Under the hood, a list is just a normal variant with a neat syntax. To illustrate this, here's how you'd declare your own int list type, without the nice syntax:

```reason
type myListType = Empty | NonEmpty int myListType;
let myList = NonEmpty 1 (NonEmpty 2 (NonEmpty 3 Empty));
/* basically [1, 2, 3] */
```

Array
-------------

Arrays are like lists, except mutable and support fast random access, for performance-sensitive scenarios.

```reason
let myArray = [|"hello", "world", "how are you"|];
let world = myArray.(1);
Array.set myArray 0 "hey";
/* now [|"hey", "world", "how are you"|] */
```

Diving Deeper
==============

Destructuring
-------------

"Destructuring" can be used to extract one or more fields from a record or
tuple, while automatically binding them to local variables. Any place variables
are introduced into scope, you may use destructuring. To destructure, instead
of writing the variable name as usual, write out the deep shape of the object.


> The following binds variables:
> `ten = 10`, `twenty = 20`

```reason
let someInts = (10, 20);
let (ten, twenty) = someInts;
```

> The following binds variables:
> `n = "Guy"`, `a = 30`

```reason
type person = {name: string, age: int};
let somePerson = {name: "Guy", age: 30};
let {name: n, age: a} = somePerson;
```

Destructuring also allows type annotations *while* destructuring.
```reason
let (ten: int, twenty: int) = someInts;
let {name: (n:string), age: (a:int)} = somePerson;
```

More on Functions
-------------------------

#### Recursive Functions

By default, values can't see a binding that points to it, but including the
`rec` keyword in a `let` binding makes this possible. This allows functions
to see and call themselves, giving us the power of recursion.

```reason
let rec neverTerminate = fun () => neverTerminate ();
```

#### Mutually Recursive Functions

Mutually recursive functions start like a single recursive function using the
`rec` keyword, and then are chained together with `and`:

```reason
let rec callSecond = fun () => callFirst ()
and callFirst = fun () => callSecond ();
```

#### Currying

Reason functions can automatically be **partially** called:

```reason
let add = fun x y => x + y;
let addFive = add 5;
let eleven = addFive 6;
let twelve = addFive 7;
```

Actually, the above `add` is actually nothing but syntactic sugar for this:

```reason
let add = fun x => fun y => x + y;
```

OCaml optimizes this to avoid the unnecessary function allocation (2 functions here, naively speaking) whenever it can! This way, we get

- Nice syntax
- Currying for free (every function takes a single argument, actually!)
- No performance cost


Imperative Loops
---------------


#### For Loops

For loops are fully imperative constructs that iterate through a range of
numbers, from a beginning value up to (and including) the ending value. The
general form of a `for` loop includes an identifier that is incremented each
iteration, and a range `startVal` to `endVal`.

```reason
for identifier in (startVal) to (endVal) {
  statements
};
```

The parenthesis around the `startVal` and `endVal` may be omitted if they are
clearly unnecessary as in the following example.

```reason
let xStart = 1;
let xEnd = 3;
/* prints: 1 2 3 */
for x in xStart to xEnd {
  print_int x;
  print_string " ";
};
```

You can make the `for` loop count in the opposite direction by using the `downto`
keyword.

```reason
for identifier in (startVal) downto (endVal) {
  statements
};
```

```reason
let xStart = 3;
let xEnd = 1;
/* prints: 3 2 1 */
for x in xStart downto xEnd {
  print_int x;
  print_string " ";
};
```

#### While Loops

While loops are also fully imperative constructs. They execute a code block
while some condition is true. The form of a `while` loop includes a single
expression, the condition to test.

```reason
while (testCondition) {
  statements;
};
```

The parenthesis around `testCondition` may be omitted if they are unnecessary,
such as in the following example.

```reason
while true {
  print_endline "hello";
};
```

Example to break out of a while-true loop:

```reason
Random.self_init ();
let break = {contents: false};
while (not break.contents) {
  if (Random.int 10 === 3) {
    break.contents = true
  } else {
    print_endline "hello"
  }
};
```

Type Arguments
----------

Types can be "parameterized" (akin to generics in other languages). It's as if a type is a function that takes in arguments and returns a new type. The parameters need to start with `'`.

Types with parameters allow us to kill duplications. Before:

```reason
/* this is a tuple of 3 items, explained next */
type intCoordinates = (int, int, int);
type floatCoordinates = (float, float, float);

let buddy: intCoordinates = (10, 20, 20);
```

After:

```reason
type coordinates 'a = ('a, 'a, 'a);

/* apply the coordinates "type function" and return the type (int, int, int) */
type intCoordinatesAlias = coordinates int;
let buddy: intCoordinatesAlias = (10, 20, 20);

/* or, more commonly, write it inline */
let buddy: coordinates float = (10.5, 20.5, 20.5);
```

In practice, types are inferred for you. So the more concise version of the above example would be nothing but:

```reason
let buddy = (10, 20, 20);
```

The type system infers that it's a `(int, int, int)`. Nothing else needed to be written down.

Type arguments appear everywhere.

```reason
/* inferred as `list string` */
let greetings = ["hello", "world", "how are you"];
```

If types didn't accept parameters (aka, if we didn't have "type functions"), the standard library will need to define the types `listOfString`, `listOfInt`, `listOfTuplesOfInt`, etc.

Types can receive more arguments, and be composable.

```reason
type result 'a 'b =
| Ok 'a
| Error 'b;

type myPayload = {data: string};

type myPayloadResults 'errorType = list (result myPayload 'errorType);

let payloadResults: myPayloadResults string = [
  Ok {data: "hi"},
  Ok {data: "bye"},
  Error "Something wrong happened!"
];
```

Exceptions
----------

Exceptions are just a special kind of [variant](#built-in-data-types-variant), "thrown" in **exceptional** cases (don't abuse them!). When you have ordinary variants, you often don't **need** exceptions, since you can just use variants types such as `type result` above.

```reason
try (somethingThatThrows ()) {
| Not_found => print_endline "Item not found!"
| Invalid_argument message => print_endline message
};
```

You can make your own exceptions like you'd make a variant (exceptions need to be capitalized too).

```
exception InputClosed string;
...
raise (InputClosed "the stream has closed!");
```

Pattern Matching
---------------------------

There are several destructuring conveniences that pair well with compiler
verified `switch` expressions.
For example, you can express arbitrarily nested destructuring "patterns", which
the compiler will ensure have no uncovered cases. In this example, `name` is
bound to `"Jo"` and `model` is bound to `"Tacoma"`.

```reason
type car = {model: string, make: string};
let toyota = {make: "Toyota", model: "Tacoma"};

type carOwner =
| CarOwner string car; /* May as well be a tuple */

let CarOwner name {model: model, make: make} =
  CarOwner "Jo" toyota;
```

This deep pattern matching is especially expressive when used in `switch`
expressions. In this example, the function `hasExactlyTwoCars` has specified
what to return in four cases in very little code. Even more helpful, is the
fact that the compiler verifies that no two edge cases are redundant, and that
every possible case has been covered. It turns out, that pattern matching
becomes an extremely powerful tool to enforce constraints in your program. The
more you model your program in terms of variants, the more the compiler assists
you stop bugs before they even run - the end result being more rapid
development. This `ML` pattern matching is famous for coining the phrase: "If
it compiles, it works!".

```reason
type car = {maker: string, model: string};
type carList =
| List car carList
| NoMore;

let chevy = {maker: "Chevy", model: "Suburban"};
let toyota = {maker: "Toyota", model: "Tacoma"};
let myCarList = List chevy (List toyota NoMore);

let hasExactlyTwoCars = fun lst =>
  switch lst {
  | NoMore => false                              /* 0 */
  | List p NoMore => false                       /* 1 */
  | List p (List p2 NoMore) => true              /* 2 */
  | List p (List p2 (List p3 theRest)) => false  /* 3+ */
  };

let justTwo = hasExactlyTwoCars myCarList;  /* true! */
```

You may have noticed that in the above `hasExactlyTwoCars`, `lst` is the only
argument and is immediately used by a `switch` expression. `Reason` has a handy
syntactic alternative for this pattern:

```reason
/* Equivalent to the above `hasExactlyTwoCars` */
let hasExactlyTwoCars = fun
| NoMore => false                              /* 0 */
| List p NoMore => false                       /* 1 */
| List p (List p2 NoMore) => true              /* 2 */
| List p (List p2 (List p3 theRest)) => false; /* 3+ */
```

Objects
----------------------------------
Although functions are the preferred way of working within Reason, it's also possible to use
objects.

An object encapsulates data that it stores within fields, and has methods that can be invoked
against the data it has.

##### Declaring an object type
An object can have an object type to define its structure.

```reason
type tesla = {
  .
  color: string
};
```
The extra dot at the beginning is to indicate that this is a closed object type, which means that
an object based on this type must have exactly this public structure.

```reason
type car 'a = {
  ..
  color: string
} as 'a;
```
Two dots, also called an elision, indicate that this is an open object type, and therefore
can also contain other values and methods. An open object is also polymorphic and therefore
requires a parameter.

An object type is not required to create an object.

##### Creating an object
```reason
type tesla = {
  .
  drive: int => int
};

let obj:tesla = {
  val hasEnvy = {contents: false};
  pub drive speed => {
    this#enableEnvy true;
    speed
  };
  pri enableEnvy envy => {
    hasEnvy.contents = envy
  };
};
```
This object is of object type tesla and has a public method `drive`. It also contains a
private method `enableEnvy` that is only accesible from within the object.

The following example shows an open object type which uses a type as parameter. The
object type parameter is required to implement all the methods of the open object
type.

```reason
type tesla 'a = {
  ..
  drive: int => int
} as 'a;

let obj:
  tesla {. drive: int => int, doYouWant: unit => bool}
  = {
  val hasEnvy = {contents: false};
  pub drive speed => {
    this#enableEnvy true;
    speed
  };
  pub doYouWant () => hasEnvy.contents;
  pri enableEnvy envy => {
    hasEnvy.contents = envy
  };
};
```

JSX
----------------------------------
Reason supports the JSX syntax, with some slight differences compared to the one in [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/introducing-jsx.html). JSX tags translate to function calls as shown in these examples:

Capitalized tag:

```reason
<MyComponent foo=bar />
```

becomes

```reason
MyComponent.createElement foo::bar children::[] () [@JSX]
```

Lowercase tag:

```reason
<div foo=bar>child1 child2</div>
```

becomes

```reason
div foo::bar children::[child1, child2] () [@JSX]
```

The `[@JSX]` syntax attribute can be safely ignored; it's a hook for potential
ppx macros to spot them and syntactically transform the preceeding expression
into something else. This way, everyone gets to benefit the JSX syntax without
needing to opt into a specific library using it, e.g. React.

Some departures from JS JSX: Children text require double quote. Attributes
don't mandate curly braces, unless they're complex expressions (in which case
they're formatted to parentheses).

```reason
<NoCurlyBraces
  booleanAttribute=true
  stringAttribute="string"
  intAttribute=1
  floatAttribute=0.1
  onClick={updater handleClick}
  thisWorksToo=(updater handleClick)>
  "foo bar"
</NoCurlyBraces>
```

There is also support for punning!

```reason
<div foo /> /* same as <div foo=foo /> */
```

Note that this would translate to `foo=true` within JSX in JS code.

There is no support for JSX spread attributes.


Automatic Printer Generation
---------------------------

*IN BETA!*

In JS, it's common to use `console.log` or `JSON.stringify` to print an object
or convert it to a string. This is not possible in OCaml. Because Reason is a
front-end to OCaml, however, we've added the functionality to convert any of
your types to a string -- for free.

```reason
type tree = Leaf | Tree tree int tree;
```

Normally, you would have to write your own stringification function to print a
`tree`, as on the right.

```reason
/* Don't you just love writing boilerplate code? */
let rec show_tree = fun
| Leaf => "Leaf"
| Tree a i b =>
  "Tree (" ^
  show_tree a ^
  ", " ^
  string_of_int i ^
  ", " ^
  show_tree b ^
  ")";
```

With Reason, however, there is no need for that. You can just assume that
`show_tree` exists (it is generated for you) and be on your merry way!

```reason
/* Golly gee! No string nonsense here! */
let myTree = Tree Leaf 4 (Tree Leaf 0 Leaf);
print_endline (show_tree myTree);
```

If you would prefer a different look for your output, feel free to override the
generated function -- simply define a function of the same name `show_tree` and
it will shadow the generated one.

Currently, this is an opt-in feature. Here's how to enable it:

* If you are using `refmt` manually, it requires adding the `--add-printers`
  flag.
* If you would like to attach the `ppx_deriving` runtime, add the
  `--add-runtime` option.
* If you are using `rebuild`, add the Ocamlbuild tag `reason.add_printers` to
  your `_tags` file for the files for which you would like printers generated.
  This implies `--add-printers --add-runtime`.

Last, please note that this will not work with polymorphic types. That is, if
you have code with a `'a` in it, Reason can't generate an automatic printer for
the generalized type.

```reason
/* Sorry, you're out of luck. */
type mytype 'a = SomeSadVariant 'a;
```

How Reason Works
=========================

The OCaml compiler is organized into several stages, which are exposed as
libraries. `Reason` replaces part of the compiler toolchain with a completely
new syntax parser that is more approachable, while still fully compatible with
the rest of the compiler.  `Reason` also implements a new source printer which
integrates into your IDE and the new custom [`REPL`](./tools.html#repl).

###### Why OCaml?

OCaml is a great tool for writing highly expressive, functional
*or* imperative code, with type inference and fast runtime performance.
Because of these properties, OCaml has helped
Facebook quickly build scalable infrastructure such as
[Hack](http://hacklang.org/), [Flow](http://flowtype.org/), and
[Infer](http://fbinfer.com/). It is also used for other performance sensitive
applications in the financial industry (Jane Street, Bloomberg). At the same
time, OCaml has a very mature (*and still growing*) ecosystem for targeting
browser and `JavaScript` environments with a focus on language interoperability
and integration with existing `JavaScript` code.


`Reason`'s non-invasive approach to the `OCaml` compiler allows `Reason` code
to take advantage of all of the existing `OCaml` compiler
optimizations/backends such as bare metal `ARM`, `x86`, and even `JavaScript`
compilation.


###### In the Wild

[Infer](https://github.com/facebook/infer/tree/master/infer) is a Facebook open
source project for statically analyzing source code in order to find errors.
You can see `Infer`'s use of `Reason`
[here](https://github.com/facebook/infer/tree/master/infer/src/IR).
The `Infer` team along with other members of industry are major contributors to
`Reason`.
