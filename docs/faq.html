Frequently Asked Questions
=======

#### Should I learn Reason or OCaml first?
There's no need to pick! Reason and OCaml share the exact same semantics (i.e. how the code runs). Only the syntax differ. Carry [Reason-tools](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-tools) around so that you can freely convert between the two syntaxes. A Reason tutorial is an OCaml tutorial, vice-versa.

#### I'm not sure what to do with Reason
[We compile to JS very well](./jsWorkflow.html). Think of what project you'd usually make if it was pure JavaScript; try porting/writing that in Reason + BuckleScript instead! We recommend trying to make concrete, end-user projects (e.g. a little command line util) rather than infra-level projects (e.g. a boilerplate generator). The latter category requires expertise and understanding idiomatic Reason code.

#### What's the relation between Reason, BuckleScript and OCaml?
See [here](./jsWorkflow.html). Reason's a syntax for OCaml and supports all its features. BuckleScript compiles OCaml/Reason code into to JavaScript.

#### What's the server-side story? Should I compile to native or to JS and use node.js?
We do compile to native, but the native workflow is currently work-in-progress. At this time, we recommend compiling to JS through BuckleScript and use the bindings at [BuckleTypes](https://github.com/buckletypes) or somewhere else.

#### What's the `.merlin` file at the root of my project?
That's the metadata file for [Merlin](./tools.html#tools-command-line-utilities-merlin), the shared editor integration backend for autocomplete, jump-to-definition, etc. For the [JavaScript Workflow](./jsWorkflow.html#javascript-workflow), `bsb` the build system generates the `.merlin` for you; You don't need to check that into your version control and don't have to manually modify it.

#### I don't see any `import` or `require` in my file; how does module resolution work?
Reason/OCaml doesn't require you to write any import; modules being referred to in the file are automatically searched in the project. Specifically, a module `Hello` asks the compiler to look for the file `hello.re` or `hello.ml` (and their corresponding [interface file](./modules.html#modules-signatures), `hello.rei` or `hello.mli`, if available).

A module name is the file name, capitalized. It has to be unique per project; this abstracts away the file system and allows you to move files around without changing code.

#### BuckleScript: Is there a generic way to transform a record into a JS object?
Not currently. You'd have to do the manual translation. Alternatively, try [using JS objects directly](http://bloomberg.github.io/bucklescript/Manual.html#_create_js_objects_using_bs_obj)

Generally speaking, we recommend binding to the JS library thinly rather than thickly and idiomatically; better stay lightweight and catch conversion mistakes.

See also our [JS interop guide](./jsWorkflow.html#javascript-workflow-talk-to-existing-js-libraries).

#### Bsb: is there a way to configure the output directory?
Not currently. We'd like to keep the configuration minimal.

#### The compiler says the module can't be found.
Are you using a third-party module? If you're compiling to JS, did you add the dependency in your [`bsconfig.json`](http://bloomberg.github.io/bucklescript/Manual.html#_get_started)'s `bs-dependencies` field? Also, did you do `bsb -make-world`? `bsb` by default only build the root project itself for performance.

Additionally, don't forget to add the source folders into your `bsconfig.json`! For performance, `bsb` doesn't automatically and recursively build nested folders.

#### Is `Some | None`, `contents`, `Array`, `List` and all of these special? Where do they come from?
They're ordinary variants/records/module definitions that comes with the [standard library](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/), `open`ed by default during compilation out of convenience.

#### What does an argument with a prepended underscore (e.g. `_` or `_foo`) mean?
Say you have `List.map (fun item => 1) myList`. The argument `item` isn't used and will generate a compiler warning. Using `fun _ => 1` instead indicates that you're intentionally receiving and ignoring the argument, therefore bypassing the warning. Alternatively, `fun _item => 1` has the same effect, but indicates more descriptively what you're ignoring.

#### What's this `MyModule.t` I keep seeing?
Assuming `MyModule` is a module's name, `t` is a community convention that indicates "the type that represents that module, whatever that means". For example, for the [`Js.String`](http://bloomberg.github.io/bucklescript/api/Js.String.html) module, [`String.t`](http://bloomberg.github.io/bucklescript/api/Js.String.html#TYPEt) is the type carried around and representing "a string".

#### Why is there a [`Js_promise`](http://bloomberg.github.io/bucklescript/api/Js_promise.html) and then a [`Js.Promise`](http://bloomberg.github.io/bucklescript/api/Js.Promise.html)? What about [`Js_array`](http://bloomberg.github.io/bucklescript/api/Js_array.html), [`Js_string`](http://bloomberg.github.io/bucklescript/api/Js_string.html) and whatever else?
As a convention, `Js_foo` is the actual module, and `Js.Foo` is just an alias for it. They're [equivalent](https://github.com/bloomberg/bucklescript/blob/7bc37f387a726ba1ae4afeefe02b9c82577d9e10/jscomp/runtime/js.ml#L124-L138). Prefer `Js.Foo`, because that's the official, public module name.

#### Why are BuckleScript and bsb so fast? How can I slow it down?
BuckleScript is optimized for performance across the whole stack. You can try slowing it down by adding a dozen layers of indirections and metaprogramming. Try:

- Adding a few infinite loops here and there.
- Stuffing a JavaScript build tool in the pipeline.
- Dragging in more dependencies for writing a hello world.
