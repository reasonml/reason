as modules. 

Modules
===========

> *Note: This documentation on modules is just a rough sketch, and will be improved*

Basic Modules
-------

Modules are like records, but with the following differences.

- They are "compile-time" concepts, not easy to pass to standard functions.
- They may contain types, instead of just values.
- Their values are specified using `let` bindings.
- Variables that refer to modules must begin with a capital letter.
- They form the basis for separate compilation and namespacing.


###### Creating Modules
To create a module, use the `let module` keywords instead of `let`, and ensure
that the variable name given to the module begins with a capital letter.

```reason
let module MyModule = {
  /* Module contents here */
};
```
The contents of modules are placed between the `{}` blocks. In fact, you
already know how to define module contents - the rules for module contents are
the exact same as the rules for the contents of `.re` files. Whatever you could
place in a `.re` file, you may place inside a module definition's `{}` block.
That means that you can include `let` bindings, and even `type` definitions.

```reason
let module MyModule = {
  type twoStrings = (string, string);
  let makePair = fun s => {
    let returnVal = (s, s): twoString;
    returnVal;
  };
};
```

Once a module has been defined, the contents of the module may be accessed much
like a record using the `.` notation. Furthermore, even a module's declared
*types* may be accessed using that same `.` notation. This demonstrates
modules' utility for namespacing.

```reason
let twoStrings: MyModule.twoString = MyModule.makePair "hello modules";
```

```reason
let module MyModule = {
  let module NestedModule = {
     let msg = "hello";
  };
};

let msg = MyModule.NestedModule.msg;
```

###### Extending modules
Contents of modules may be *copied* into other modules by using the `include`
keyword. Once `include`d, following `let` bindings can "see" the `include`d
content. This can often fulfill the role of "inheritance".


```reason
let module Login = {
   let login = fun auth => 0;
};
let module RepeatedLogin = {
  include Login;
  let loginTwice = fun auth => {
    (login auth, login auth)
  };
};
```


###### Every `.re` file is a module
Furthermore, ever file *is* a module. The file `react.re` implicitly forms a
module `React`, which can be seen by other source files. The [build
system](#scalable-development-modules-and-package-visibility) determines which
particular files can see `React`.



Signatures
----------------------------------
Similar to how records are described by types, modules themselves can be
described by *module* types, which we call "signatures". Signatures are similar
to record type definitions, with the following differences:

- They describe the structure of *modules* (which are compile-time constructs)
  instead of describing *values* (which are runtime constructs).
- They describe values being inside of modules via the following syntax: `let q: s;` (as opposed to
  `key:keyType,`).
- Signatures can include entries for `type` fields - which is admitedly
  difficult to wrap your head around.
- Identifiers that refer to signatures must begin with a capital letter.
- The rules for satisfying signatures are based on "subtyping", whereas records
  are more rigid.

###### Creating Signatures
Module signatures are declared using the `module type` keywords.  Module
signatures define the list of requirements that a module must satisfy in order
for that module to "match". Those requirements are of the form:

- `let x: typeOfName;` to require that a module have a `let` binding named `x`.
- `type t = someType;` to require that a module have a type field `t` being
  equal to `someType`.
- `type t;` to require that a module have a type field `t`, but without
  imposing any requirements on the actual type of `t`. We can still use this `t`
  in other entries in the signature, which will require enforce certain
  relationships between `t` and other types/fields *within* the signature, but
  we cannot, for example, assume that `t` is an `int`.

To illustrate the various kinds of type entries, consider the signature
`HasXAndTInt` which requires that a module:

- Declare a type definition under the name `t` being equivalent to `int`.
- Must include a `let` binding named `x` assigned to an `int`.

```reason
module type HasXAndTInt = {
   type t = int;
   let x: int;
};
```

Contrast that with the signature `HasXAndTAbstract` which requires that a
module:

- Declare a type definition under the name `t`.
- Have a `let` binding `x` that is of that *same* type `t`, regardless of what `t` happens to be.

```reason
module type HasXAndTAbstract = {
   type t;
   let x: t;
};
```

###### Asserting
Similar to what we saw with type assertions, we can assert that various
*modules* implement various *signatures*, via the type assertion operator `:`.

In this example, the first type assertion asserts that `XTInt` implements
`HasXAndTInt` and it succeeds because `XTint` has all of the members of
`HasXAndTInt` and the types of those members match exactly.  The second
assertion asserts that `XTInt` implements `HasXAndTAbstract` and succeeds
because `XTInt.x` is in fact of type `XTint.t`. `XTint.t` also happens to be an
`int`, but `HasXAndTAbstract` never specified what `t` could or could not be -
it only required that `x` be of type `t`.

```reason
let module XTInt: HasXAndTInt = {
   type t = int;
   let x = 20;
};
let module XTInt: HasXAndTAbstract = {
   type t = int;
   let x = 20;
};
```
###### Constraining
What it means to "implement" a signature is fairly intuitive, and roughly
corresponds to the popular notion of "implementing an interface". For example,
modules may implement a signature while having *more* fields (but no fewer)
than the signature required.

Because of this, signature assertions do more than just *verify* that a module
implements, a signature - they also *constrain* a module to the signature. In
this example, `XYAndT.y` is visible, but `Constrained.y` is not.  Furthermore,
`XYAndT.t` is of type `int`, whereas `Constrained.t` now matches the signature
in that it is now "abstract". If you were to ask the `REPL` what the type of
`Constrained.t` is, it will tell you `Constrained.t`! If you asked it what the
type of `Constrained.x` was, it would again tell you `Constrained.t`. It has
lost track of the type itself, but not lost track of the fact that the type of
`Constrained.x` is identical to the type of `Constrained.t`.

```reason
let module XYAndT = {
   type t = int;
   let x = 20;
   let y = "you'll never see me!";
};
let module Constrained: HasXAndTAbstract = XYAndT;
```
> This kind of "constraining" allows *hiding* of information that should be
> considered implementation details.


###### Every `.rei` file is a signature
Similar to how every `react.re` file implicitly defines a module `React`, every
file `react.rei` implicitly defines a signature that is automatically asserts
and constrains `React`. The optional `react.rei` file would include the
contents of a module signature (stuff in between the `{}`). `.rei` files also
serve as a place to document the public API for their corresponding modules.

> Example contents of react.re

```reason
type descriptor = int;
let render = fun str => str;
```

> Example contents of react.rei

```reason
type descriptor = int;
let render: str => str;
```

- Module signatures may also help ensure that [incremental
  compilation](#scalable-development-incremental-compilation)
  remains fast.
- Signatures have many powerful features for constraining relationships between
  modules in very nuanced ways. Those are out of the scope of this document.

Module Functions
----------------------------------
Modules act as compile-time records, and signatures act as the types of those
compile-time records, but the most power comes from being able to pass modules
through functions. But since modules are compile-time constructs, we can't use
*regular* runtime functions - we need functions that can operate on *modules*.
We call these special functions "functors", and designate them by using the keyword
`functor` instead of `fun` at definition time.

> The combination of modules, signatures and module functions are incredibly
powerful, especially when combined with module `include`ing. Together they
provide power that feels much like a type based macro systems, allowing the
creation of sophisticated type hierarchies, generators, and factories. Covering
all of these use cases are out of the scope of this document.

The syntax for defining and using module functions is very much like the syntax for
defining and using regular functions. The primary differences are:


- Module functions use the `let module` keywords instead of `let` and the `functor`
  keyword instead of `fun`.
- Module functions accept modules as arguments and return a module.
- Module functions *require* annotating arguments.
- Module functions must start with a capital letter (just like modules/signatures).

```reason
module type HasT = {
  type t;
};
let module Pairify = functor (X: HasT) => {
   type p = (X.t, X.t);
   let create = fun (x: X.t) => (x, x);
};
```
Module functions can be "applied" using function application syntax, by passing modules
as their space-separated arguments.
In this case, a module *literal* is passed as the module functions argument, but we
could have passed the name of a module instead.

```reason
let module IntPair = Pairify {
  type t = int;
};

let ints = IntPair.create 200;
```

Module functions, among other things can for powerful module type (*and* value)
factories. Module functions can even accept other Module functions as arguments!


###### Module functions types

Module functions may have type assertions applied with `:` as we've seen with values
and modules. Like with module types, module function types also act to *constrain* what
we may assume about module functions, beyond what is true about them (you may hide
things about the module function).
The syntax for module function types are consistent with those for function types, but
with types capitalized to represent the signatures of modules the module function
accepts as arguments and return values.


> Previous example with module function type assertions.

```reason
module type HasT = {
  type t;
};
module type ParifyT = (HasTInstance: HasT) => {
  type p;
  let create: HasTInstance.t => p;
};

let module Pairify: ParifyT = functor (X:HasT) => {
  type p = (X.t, X.t);
  let create = fun (x: X.t) => (x, x);
};
```
