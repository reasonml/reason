  TODO: IDE integration beginning with Vim:

  - Create recovering version of parser that creates regions of "unknown"
    content in between let sequence bindings (anything between semicolons,
    really).
  - Use Easy_format's "style" features to tag each known node.
  - Turn those style annotations into editor highlight commands.
  - Editors have a set of keys that retrigger the parsing/rehighlighting
    process (typically newline/semi/close-brace).
  - On every parsing/rehighlighting, this pretty printer can be used to
    determine the highlighting of recovered regions, and the editor plugin can
    relegate highlighting of malformed regions to the editor which mostly does
    so based on token patterns.

   - The last argument to a function application is expanded on the same line.
   - Only if it's not curried with another invocation.

(*
 * For simplicity, the formatting of comments happens in two parts in context of a source map:
 * 1) insert the singleLineComments with the interleaving algorithm contained in
 *    `insertSingleLineComment` for all comments overlapping with the sourcemap.
 *    A `Layout.Whitespace` node signals an intent to preserve whitespace here.
 * 2) SingleLineComments after the sourcemap, e.g. at the end of .re/.rei file,
 *    get attached with `appendSingleLineCommentsToEnd`. Due to the fact there
 *    aren't any real ocaml ast nodes anymore after the sourcemap (end of a
 *    file), the printing of the comments can be done in one pass with
 *    `appendSingleLineCommentsToEnd`. This is more performant and
 *    simplifies the implementation of comment attachment.

     It's not enough to only check if precedence of an infix left/right is
     greater than the infix itself. We also should likely pay attention to
     left/right associativity. So how do we render the minimum number of
     parenthesis?

     The intuition is that sequential right associative operators will
     naturally build up deep trees on the right side (left builds up left-deep
     trees). So by default, we add parens to model the tree structure that
     we're rendering except when the parser will *naturally* parse the tree
     structure that the parens assert.

     Sequential identical infix operators:
     ------------------------------------
     So if we see a nested infix operator of precedence Y, as one side of
     another infix operator that has the same precedence (Y), that is S
     associative on the S side of the function application, we don't need to
     wrap in parens. In more detail:

     -Add parens around infix binary function application
       Exception 1: Unless we are a left-assoc operator of precedence X in the left branch of an operator w/ precedence X.
       Exception 2: Unless we are a right-assoc operator of precedence X in the right branch of an operator w/ precedence X.
       Exception 3: Unless we are a _any_-assoc X operator in the _any_ branch of an Y operator where X has greater precedence than Y.

     Note that the exceptions do not specify any special cases for mixing
     left/right associativity. Precedence is what determines necessity of
     parens for operators with non-identical precedences. Associativity
     only determines necessity of parens for identically precedented operators.

     PLUS is left assoc:
     - So this one *shouldn't* expand into two consecutive infix +:


            [Pexp_apply]
              /      \
         first +   [Pexp_apply]
                      /   \
                  second + third


     - This one *should*:

                    [Pexp_apply]
                      /      \
           [  Pexp_apply  ] + third
              /     \
           first +  second



     COLONCOLON is right assoc, so
     - This one *should* expand into two consecutive infix ::  :

            [Pexp_apply]
              /      \
         first ::   [Pexp_apply]
                      /   \
                  second :: third


     - This one *shouldn't*:

                    [Pexp_apply]
                      /      \
           [  Pexp_apply  ] :: third
              /     \
           first ::  second




     Sequential differing infix operators:
     ------------------------------------

     Neither of the following require paren grouping because of rule 3.


            [Pexp_apply]
              /      \
         first  +  [Pexp_apply]
                      /   \
                  second * third


                    [Pexp_apply]
                      /      \
            [Pexp_apply  +  third
              /     \
           first *  second

      The previous has nothing to do with the fact that + and * have the same
      associativity. Exception 3 applies to the following where :: is right assoc
      and + is left. + has higher precedence than ::

      - so parens aren't required to group + when it is in a branch of a
        lower precedence ::

            [Pexp_apply]
              /      \
         first ::   [Pexp_apply]
                      /   \
                  second + third


      - Whereas there is no Exception that applies in this case (Exception 3
        doesn't apply) so parens are required around the :: in this case.

                    [Pexp_apply]
                      /      \
           [  Pexp_apply  ] + third
              /     \
           first ::  second

  (* Reinterpret this as a pattern constraint since we don't currently have a
     way to disambiguate. There is currently a way to disambiguate a parsing
     from Ppat_constraint vs.  Pexp_constraint. Currently (and consistent with
     OCaml standard parser):

       let (x: typ) = blah;
         Becomes Ppat_constraint
       let x:poly . type = blah;
         Becomes Ppat_constraint
       let x:typ = blah;
         Becomes Pexp_constraint(ghost)
       let x = (blah:typ);
         Becomes Pexp_constraint(ghost)

     How are double constraints represented?
     let (x:typ) = (blah:typ);
     If currently both constraints are parsed into a single Pexp_constraint,
     then something must be lost, and how could you fail type checking on:
     let x:int = (10:string) ?? Answer: It probably parses into a nested
     Pexp_constraint.

     Proposal:

       let (x: typ) = blah;
         Becomes Ppat_constraint   (still)
       let x:poly . type = blah;
         Becomes Ppat_constraint   (still)
       let x:typ = blah;
         Becomes Ppat_constraint
       let x = blah:typ;
         Becomes Pexp_constraint


     Reasoning: Allows parsing of any of the currently valid ML forms, but
     combines the two most similar into one form. The only lossyness is the
     unnecessary parens, which there is already precedence for dropping in
     expressions. In the existing approach, preserving a paren-constrained
     expression is *impossible* because it becomes pretty printed as
     let x:t =.... In the proposal, it is not impossible - it is only
     impossible to preserve unnecessary parenthesis around the let binding.

     The one downside is that integrating with existing code that uses [let x =
     (blah:typ)] in standard OCaml will be parsed as a Pexp_constraint. There
     might be some lossiness (beyond parens) that occurs in the original OCaml
     parser.

  (*
   * Provides special printing for constructor arguments:
   * iff there's one argument & they have some kind of wrapping,
   * they're wrapping need to 'hug' the surrounding parens.
   * Example:
   *  switch x {
   *  | Some({
   *      a,
   *      b,
   *    }) => ()
   *  }
   *
   *  Notice how ({ and }) hug.
   *  This applies for records, arrays, tuples & lists.
   *  Also see `isSingleArgParenPattern` to determine if this kind of wrapping applies.

     How do modules become parsed?
     let module (X: sig) = blah;
       Will not parse! (Should just make it parse to let [X:sig =]).
     let module X: sig = blah;
       Becomes Pmod_constraint
     let module X: sig = (blah:sig);
       Becomes Pmod_constraint .. Pmod_constraint
     let module X = blah:typ;
       Becomes Pmod_constraint
     let module X (Y:y) (Z:z):r => Q
       Becomes Pmod_functor...=> Pmod_constraint

     let module X (Y:y) (Z:z):r => (Q:r2)
       Probably becomes Pmod_functor...=> (Pmod_constraint..
       Pmod_constraint)

    let (module X) =
      Is a *completely* different thing (unpacking/packing first class modules).
      We should make sure this is very well distinguished.
      - Just replace all "let module" with a new three letter keyword (mod)?
      - Reserve let (module X) for unpacking first class modules.

    See the notes about how Ppat_constraint become parsed and attempt to unify
    those as well.
