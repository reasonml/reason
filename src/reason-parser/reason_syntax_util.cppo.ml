(* Hello! Welcome to the Reason syntax util logic.

  This file's shared between the Reason repo and the BuckleScript repo. In
  Reason, it's in src/reason-parser. In BuckleScript, it's in
  jscomp/outcome_printer. We periodically copy this file from Reason (the source
  of truth) to BuckleScript, then uncomment the #if #else #end cppo macros you
  see in the file. That's because BuckleScript's on OCaml 4.02 while Reason's on
  4.04; so the #if macros surround the pieces of code that are different between
  the two compilers.

  When you modify this file, please make sure you're not dragging in too many
  things. You don't necessarily have to test the file on both Reason and
  BuckleScript; ping @chenglou and a few others and we'll keep them synced up by
  patching the right parts, through the power of types(tm)

(** What do these *_swap functions do? Here's an example: Reason code uses `!`
    for logical not, while ocaml uses `not`. So, for converting between reason
    and ocaml syntax, ocaml `not` converts to `!`, reason `!` converts to
    `not`.

    In more complicated cases where a reserved keyword exists in one syntax but
    not the other, these functions translate any potentially conflicting
    identifier into the same identifier with a suffix attached, or remove the
    suffix when converting back. Two examples:

    reason to ocaml:

    pub: invalid in reason to begin with
    pub_: pub
    pub__: pub_

    ocaml to reason:

    pub: pub_
    pub_: pub__
    pub__: pub___

    =====

    reason to ocaml:

    match: match_
    match_: match__
    match__: match___

    ocaml to reason:

    match: invalid in ocaml to begin with
    match_: match
