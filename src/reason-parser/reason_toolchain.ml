(* Entry points in the parser *)

(**
 * Provides a simple interface to the most common parsing entrypoints required
 * by editor/IDE toolchains, preprocessors, and pretty printers.
 *
 * The form of this entrypoint includes more than what the standard OCaml
 * toolchain (oprof/ocamldoc) expects, but is still compatible.
 *
 * [implementation_with_comments] and [interface_with_comments] includes
 * additional information (about comments) suitable for building pretty
 * printers, editor, IDE and VCS integration.
 *
 * The comments include the full text of the comment (typically in between the
 * "(*" and the "*)", as well as location information for that comment.
 *
 * WARNING: The "end" location is one greater than the actual final position!
 * (for both [associatedTextLoc] and [commentLoc]).
 *
 * Currently, the location information for comments is of the form:
 *
 *  (associatedTextLoc)
 *
 * But we should quickly change it to be of the form:
 *
 *  (associatedTextLoc, commentLoc)
 *
 * Where the [commentLoc] is the actual original location of the comment,
 * and the [associatedTextLoc] records the location in the file that the
 * comment is attached to. If [associatedTextLoc] and [commentLoc] are the
 * same, then the comment is "free floating" in that it only attaches to itself.
 * The [Reason] pretty printer will try its best to interleave those comments
 * in the containing list etc. But if [associatedTextLoc] expands beyond
 * the [commentLoc] it means the comment and the AST that is captured by
 * the [associatedTextLoc] are related - where "related" is something
 * this [reason_toolchain] decides (but in short it handles "end of line
 * comments"). Various pretty printers can decide how to preserve this
 * relatedness. Ideally, it would preserve end of line comments, but in the
 * short term, it might merely use that relatedness to correctly attach
 * end of line comments to the "top" of the AST node.
 *
 *    let lst = [
 *
 *    ];   (*    Comment    *)
 *         ----commentLoc-----
 *    ---associatedTextLoc----
 *
 *
 * Ideally that would be formatted as:
 *
 *    let lst = [
 *
 *    ];   (*    Comment    *)
 *
 * Or:
 *
 *    let lst = [ ];   (*    Comment    *)
 *
 *
 * But a shorter term solution would use that [associatedTextLoc] to at least
 * correctly attach the comment to the correct node, even if not "end of line".
 *
 *   (*    Comment    *)
 *   let lst = [ ];
